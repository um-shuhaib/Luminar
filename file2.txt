File handling refers to the process of performing operations on a file such as creating, opening, reading, writing and closing it, through a programming interface. 
It involves managing the data flow between the program and the file system on the storage device, ensuring that data is handled safely and efficiently.
To open a file we can use open() function, which requires file path and mode as arguments.
Writing to a file is done using file.write() which writes the specified string to the file. 
If the file exists, its content is erased.
If it doesn't exist, a new file is created.
Reading a file can be achieved by file.read() which reads the entire content of the file.
After reading the file we can close the file using file.close() which closes the file after reading it, which is necessary to free up system resources.
Closing a file is essential to ensure that all resources used by the file are properly released.
file.close() method closes the file and ensures that any changes made to the file are saved.
with statement is used for resource management.
It ensures that file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.
with open() as method automatically handles closing the file once the block of code is exited, even if an error occurs.
